# UTSA-Abnormal-Psychology-2019
# Motivation and Essential Understandings
Research has consistently shown that evidence-based assessment is necessary to inform evidence-based therapeutic interventions or treatment.  Existing self-report measures tend to focus on either risk or protective factors for the assessment of military Veterans with a series of combat-related experiences. The MSRI-28 has the advantage of evaluating risk and protective factors simultaneously. This lesson will examine the contribution of evaluating the responses of groups of Veterans with a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; DSM-5) between two groups: exposed to combat vs. not exposed.

•	How do risk and protective factors correlate to suicide in military Veterans?

# Context and Dataset
Students will interpret trends for and form hypotheses using data from the Multidimensional Suicide-related Response Inventory-28 (MSRI-28) published by Dr. Augustine Osman, Professor of Clinal Psychology, University of Texas at San Antonio. Students will document results as a summative project.

# Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:

•	Describe methods of exploratory data analysis used in research

•	Analyze hypotheses for data-related to risk and protective factors for PTSD

•	Evaluate a predictive model to inform decision making for evidence-based assessment

•	Describe methods of exploratory data analysis used in research

# Data Science Concepts and Skills
1.	Summary statistics
2.	Exploratory data analysis; Static and interactive data visualization
3.	Data wrangling; data dictionary
4.	Hypothesis testing
5.	Predictive modeling with Decision tree; Random Forest

# Students
This lesson is for late undergraduate students. Students should be familiar with statistical concepts, basic data visualizations, and have worked in Excel. In addition, students will run models in notebooks coded in R. 

# Time to Teach this Lesson 
This lesson can be taught in 3 sessions along with TA assistance in running models in R
